# loan-calculator
Loan calculator project from Brad Traversy's Modern Javascript From The Beginning course on Udemy.

Some things I changed:
- Cleaned up the js code a little bit from Brad's: some DOM variables were stored inside functions so I took them out and placed them at the top of the doc instead for better readability.
- Fixed the UI: The version of Bootstrap I was using was a newer one from the tutorial and did not match Brad's UI so I imported a CSS stylesheet to get it closer to his and make the UI look more presentable.
